## BearJoy - MA Bears Team 766 2018 Gamepad code

This repository is forked from: https://github.com/AlanChatham/UnoJoy

It contains the custom `BearJoy` Arduino project, set up with the 2018 gamepad code.

With an Arduino Mega, be sure the use the "Mega" variant of the "TurnIntoAnArduino" script:
`MegaJoy/TurnIntoAnArduino.bat`

If not, you can accidentally turn your Arduino Mega into an Arduino Uno (read: "Brick"), which it really doesn't like.


Good luck installing all of the right software! Follow the README at the root of this repo carefully to find all the right software.
